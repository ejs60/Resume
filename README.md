Work Experience
12-month Engineering internship with Verizon-Terremark (September 2015- August 2016), consisting of onsite work at the Miami Network Access Point of the Americas
-	Performed floor balancing ensuring cabinet’s inlet temperatures were at peak efficiency
-	Assisted in design layout of temperature sensor controllers and repeaters
-	Validated accuracy of registered equipment in the Verizon hardware database using Excel

Internship Summary: the Verizon Principle Engineer sent a report to leadership documenting my work, calculating that I was personally responsible for $250,000 in ongoing annual savings 
Applied Knowledge
R for Data Analysis (Data Cleaning and Predictive Modeling) 
-	Created Logistic, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine models to predict hospital readmission rates among hospital patients
o	Used K-Fold Validation to estimate predictive capability of models
o	Performed under sampling techniques when necessary to limit model bias 
-	Created Linear Regression model to predict housing prices in King County, Washington
o	Developed data visualization with “ggmap” library to gain insight into which regions were associated with the most expensive homes
Simulation Modeling (with Arena and Excel)
-	 Created inventory production and control simulation in excel to determine optimal order times and inventory capacities
o	Used macro to develop user-friendly method for searching for multi-variable optimal solution within stochastic simulation data
-	Conducted complex simulation of airport passenger arrival system using Arena software to determine the maximum number of workers needed at various stations throughout the system.
o	Data from simulation was exported from to R for system analysis and data visualization
Human Factors
-	Analyzed the University of Miami student course selection process to improve human-system interaction for overall process improvement
Leadership/Campus Involvement:
-	Head Coach, University of Miami Club Baseball
-	Peer Tutor at University of Miami Resource Center (in Probability/Statistics and Economics)
